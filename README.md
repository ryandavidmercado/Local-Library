# Local-Library
A project for Thinkful demonstrating use of advanced JavaScript techniques and data organization.
My original code and algorithms can be found in /public/src, where each .js file was written by myself.

The frontend, which can previewed live below, employs the alogrithms written in public/src to parse and display the necessary data.
